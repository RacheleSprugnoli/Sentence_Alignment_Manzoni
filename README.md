# Sentence_Alignment_Manzoni

This repository contains the output of different ongoing works aimed at creating new parallel texts related to the Alessandro Manzoni's novel "I Promessi Sposi" (The Betrothed).

Currently, the repository gives access to:
- a parallel corpus made of the whole text of Ventisettana, that is the version of the novel published by Manzoni in 1827, aligned at sentence level with the 1834 anonymous English translation. The text of the Ventisettana in digital format was provided by the Italian project (PRIN 2017) *[ManzoniOnline2: new documents, translations and tradition](https://www.alessandromanzoni.org/)*, whereas the text of the 1834 English translation was downloaded from the [Gutenberg project](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35155) website as UTF-8 text file. The alignment was performed using the [InterText editor](https://wanthalf.saga.cz/intertext) by Marco Sartor and Rachele Sprugnoli. Each chapter is saved as two independent XML files (one for the Italian text and one for the English translation) and their alignment is exported as a separate XML file containing pointers to the individual sentences of the two texts: this alignment files can be imported into InterText.
